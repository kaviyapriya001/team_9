          <p style="color:WhiteSmoke;font-size:150%">You likely can’t escape news about coronavirus (COVID-19), and it may be making you worried. As the virus is confirmed in more places across the globe, you might be wondering what will happen when it comes to your community. Although a pandemic is scary, try to remember that you likely don’t need to worry about coronavirus if your area doesn’t have any confirmed cases. However, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) do recommend that everyone take basic steps to prepare for coronavirus so fewer people get sick.</p>
          <p style="color:Crimson;font-size:200%">Preventing the Virus from Spreading</p>
          <p style="color:WhiteSmoke;font-size:150%">
          Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. It’s so simple, but washing your hands is the best way to protect yourself from getting sick. Wet your hands under warm running water, then apply a mild soap to your palm. Rub your hands together for 20 seconds, then rinse the soap away under warm running water.
          Alcohol-based sanitizers may help prevent the virus, as well. Use them in addition to handwashing but not as a replacement. Sanitizers that have 60% to 95% alcohol are good to use.</p>

          Practice physical distancing by staying home as much as possible</p>
          <p style="color:white;font-size:150%">
          Practice physical distancing by staying home as much as possible. The virus spreads more easily in groups, especially crowds. Fortunately, you can help protect yourself and others by just staying home. Only go out when it's necessary, like when you need to go grocery shopping. Otherwise, enjoy your time at home.
          If you are at high risk and have an essential worker family member, you have to be more careful and try to limit contact with the person to keep yourself safe.
          If you do decide to socialize, the recommendation in the US is to keep gatherings to 10 people or less. Remember even young or healthy people can contract the virus and spread it to others. In other regions check with local government or health authorities for what types of gatherings are allowed.
          There are tons of ways to have fun at home! You might play games, make something, read a book, play outside, or watch a movie.
          <br>
          Stay at least 6 ft (1.8 m) away from other people when in public. You may need to go out in public for things like grocery shopping. Try to maintain space between yourself and other community members just in case any of you are sick. It's possible to spread COVID-19 before symptoms start, so play it safe by staying away.</p>
          
          <p style="color:Crimson;font-size:200%">
          Keep your hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth</p>
          
          <p style="color:white;font-size:150%">Keep your hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth. Typically, the coronavirus infects you when you either inhale droplets from an infected person’s sneeze or cough or touch your face with droplets on your hands. Don’t touch your face unless you’ve just washed your hands. Otherwise, you may accidentally introduce germs into your body.
          Use tissues to wipe your nose or cover a cough if possible, as your hands could be dirty.

          <p style="color:white;font-size:150%">Avoid shaking hands with other people, whether they appear sick or not. Unfortunately, people who are infected with coronavirus can spread the illness even if they aren’t showing symptoms. To be safe, don’t shake hands with anyone until the coronavirus threat is over. Instead, politely decline a handshake and explain that you’re trying to prevent coronavirus.
          You might say, “It’s nice to meet you, too. Normally I’d shake your hand, but the CDC recommends avoiding handshakes until the coronavirus threat is over.”
